          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">1. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>
            The Service provides a self-serve IT ticketing platform with features including ticket management, SLA tracking, custom fields, automations, and user portals. Hosted on Cloudflare infrastructure. Each subscription deploys an isolated instance. Service is provided "as is" and may contain bugs or interruptions, as it is a new platform. We are confident in its current state, but we are actively developing new tools and additions. It is possible you may have to refresh from time to time, we offer notifications when updates are pushed to production but we strive to do this in the early hours of the morning to prevent any interruptions.
